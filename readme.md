Fixed TOCs (Blog & Docs): Adjusted CSS for better cross-browser compatibility with position: sticky.

Mobile Horizontal Scroll: Added overflow-x: hidden to the body to prevent this.

Mobile Landscape Header: Added a media query to hide the header on small devices in landscape orientation.

Mobile TOC Dropdown:

Prevented header disappearance by adjusting styles.

Modified the toggle button's behavior so clicking it again closes the dropdown.

Simplified Right Header: Removed the language switcher dropdown, leaving only the search icon.

PDF Fullscreen Button: Added a "View Fullscreen / New Tab" button below the PDF embed using the existing shortcode.
